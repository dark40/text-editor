# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Deployment App

[Heorku App](https://serene-shelf-95717.herokuapp.com/)

## User Story
